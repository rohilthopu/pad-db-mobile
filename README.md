#  PAD DB (iOS)

I will be updating the documentation and contributing information shortly. I'll also be adding in a couple images for viewing without downloading the app.


To those who want to contribute or clone the app for local use, there is one file missing that contains references to my own API endpoints, which currently are not public. It
will effectively render the app useless without them. I will provide them if you plan on contributing, but because the backend is still pretty much under construction, the data structure
might change more often than I'd like, hence why it's not public.
