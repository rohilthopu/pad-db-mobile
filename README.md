#  PAD DB (iOS)

PAD DB is a resource to access Puzzle and Dragons (PAD) data in a mobile friendly form. This specific repository refers to the
mobile implementation of the project that runs on devices running iOS 11+. 

The app provides access to Guerrilla Dungeons, Monsters, and Dungeon information.

Some example images can be seen below:

<div display="flex" align="center">
    <img src="Images/iphone_max_home.png" height="30%" width="30%">
    <img src="Images/ney_1.png" height="30%" width="30%">
    <img src="Images/ney_2.png" height="30%" width="30%">
</div>

## Current Goals

1. Maybe rewrite in SwiftUI
2. Put the app on the app store
3. Get a better app icon
4. Use async http requests
5. Add a favorites feature

## Installation

If you want to install official releases, which I encourage, you can download them on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JcBpe6eL). Hopefully I can get around to putting this on the App Store in the next month.
